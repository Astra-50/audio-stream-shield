# **AudioGuard ‚Äì Masterplan**

## **üéØ App Overview and Objectives**

AudioGuard is a real-time DMCA detection and alert platform built for Twitch streamers. Its goal is to protect creators from takedowns, strikes, or bans by monitoring their livestream audio and alerting them instantly when risky music is detected. AudioGuard operates through a Discord bot and a web dashboard, emphasizing a fast, protective, and nearly invisible presence during live broadcasts.

## **üë• Target Audience**

* Twitch streamers with 500‚Äì5,000 followers

* Creators who monetize via ads, subscriptions, and sponsorships

* Streamers already using overlays, bots, and audio tools

## **üß© Core Features and Functionality**

### **Discord Bot**

* Joins private channels to send DMCA risk alerts

* ‚ÄúPanic button‚Äù command to mute or trigger overlay alerts

* Permission-aware and rate-limited to avoid spam

### **Web Dashboard**

* Email/password or Discord OAuth login

* View audio alerts with timestamps and risk confidence

* Set detection sensitivity and webhook targets

* Manage subscription tier (Free, Pro, Premium)

### **Pricing & Marketing Pages**

* Free tier: panic button only

* Paid tiers: real-time alerts, history logs, AI shield (future)

* Stripe integration for billing

* Case studies and testimonials page

## **üõ†Ô∏è High-Level Technical Stack**

* **Frontend**: Vite \+ React \+ TypeScript \+ shadcn/ui \+ Tailwind CSS

* **Backend**: Supabase (auth, storage, database)

* **Discord Integration**: Bot for alerts and panic command

* **Audio Capture**: OBS integration via virtual audio routing (VB-Cable, Loopback)

* **Audio Analysis**: Fingerprinting via 5s audio chunks, confidence thresholding

* **AI (Future)**: Integrate with ACRCloud or AudD for detection

* **Billing**: Stripe

## **üß± Conceptual Data Model**

* **User**: ID, email, Discord ID, subscription tier

* **StreamSession**: ID, user ID, start time, end time

* **AudioAlert**: ID, session ID, timestamp, track info, risk level

* **Settings**: User-specific sensitivity, webhook config

## **üé® User Interface Design Principles**

* Font: Inter

* Primary color: \#1C1C1C (Dark Gray/Black)

* Accent color: \#FA3C4C (Red for alerts)

* Layout: Mobile-first, real-time updating card UI

* Alerts: Easy to skim and understand at a glance

## **üîê Security Considerations**

* OAuth \+ email/password login with Supabase

* Role-based access control (admin vs user)

* Secure WebSocket or HTTPS transmission for audio data

* Bot permissions scoped to only alert channels

## **üöÄ Development Phases or Milestones**

1. **Phase 1: MVP**

   * Discord bot with panic button

   * OBS audio capture setup guide

   * Basic alerting with manual logs

2. **Phase 2: Web Dashboard**

   * Authentication and alert history view

   * Sensitivity settings and basic logs

3. **Phase 3: Paid Tier \+ Stripe**

   * Subscription management

   * Feature gating based on tier

4. **Phase 4: AI-Powered Shield (Optional)**

   * Live fingerprinting with AI model

   * Auto-muting or auto-overlay trigger

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges and Solutions**

* **Audio accuracy**: Calibrate thresholds, allow tuning

* **Cross-platform compatibility**: Offer alternative routing solutions

* **Bot noise**: Throttle alerts and bundle similar events

* **Database accuracy**: Use open-source or partner libraries first

## **üìà Future Expansion Possibilities**

* Auto-moderation overlays (e.g., visual warnings)

* Streamer-focused mobile app for alerts

* Alerts via SMS or other webhook targets

* Partnerships with audio libraries (e.g., stream-safe labels)
