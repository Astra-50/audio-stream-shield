# **AudioGuard – Design Guidelines**

## **🖼️ Visual Style**

* **Font**: Inter (clean, legible, modern)

* **Primary Color**: \#1C1C1C (Dark Gray / Black)

* **Accent Color**: \#FA3C4C (Alert Red)

* **Background**: White and soft neutral grays

* **Iconography**: Use alert, shield, and waveform imagery

* **Brand Voice**: Protective, reassuring, technical but friendly

## **📐 Layout Principles**

* Mobile-first, responsive design

* Dashboard uses cards for each alert log item

* Realtime UI feedback (e.g., spinners or flashing borders when new alert received)

* Logical groupings: session data, settings, alert history, subscription info

* Markdown/Discord-like UI for alert channel logs

## **♿ Accessibility & Usability**

* High contrast for alert states (Red/Black/White)

* ARIA labels for interactive elements

* Alt text on icons/images

* Focus on legibility and fast scanning (streamers are multitasking)

## **🧭 Navigation Structure**

* Web app nav bar includes: Dashboard, Settings, Billing, Testimonials

* Use tabs or accordions to keep panels digestible

* Sticky footer or top bar for panic button (on mobile)

## **🧑‍🎤 Brand Tone and Voice**

* Friendly but focused (“We’ve got your back.”)

* Avoid legalese or FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt)

* Messaging emphasizes speed, control, and peace of mind
